## Getting started using the apis

There are many ways you could use for accessing the api. Here is a [introductory guide](introduction.md) covering the basics around web apis

### Getting token from Maskinporten

To access the api and data within you need a valid Bearer token, this token proves who you are and that you have access to our API. 
Maskinporten is a trusted 3rd party that we use for guaranteeing this. A guide covering the aquisition of tokens and the setup needed to integrate with Maskinporten is [here](token.md). Once you have a valid Token you can access data relevant to your organisation.

### Familiarizing yourself with the API

To familiarize yourself with our API we recomend using the Azure API management web frontend. whe have made a [guide](developmentportal.md) on how to use this.

### Developing API CLients
